## 👉🏽 The choice

<p>
  
  The chosen game this time was `Battleship`. Is it true that developing this type of game would be easier in another programming language rather than `Java`? Yes, it is.
  
</p>
<p>
  But for those who enjoy a challenge, developing this game in Java was a great choice.
</p>
<p>
  A choice that came with many headaches, several months of development, but in the end, what matters is that it worked -- and it was a success.
</p>

## 🎮 The game

<p>
  
  The game is 100% developed in `Java` using **Object-Oriented Programming**. The menus were mostly created through lines of code, with a small part built using features from the compiler used: `Eclipse IDE`. 
> [!NOTE]\
> If you want to download the IDE that I used, click [here](https://eclipseide.org)
</p>

<p>At the time, this was the longest and most difficult project I had ever done.</p>
<p>Connecting multiple menus, files, images, lines of code, and buttons to create a sense of harmony was the main challenge.</p>

<p>
  
  For a 16-year-old who had only worked with `C++` before, switching to **Object-Oriented Programming** in `Java` was no easy task.
</p>

<p>I admit, there may be some lines of code that are unnecessary or could be optimized, but at 16, this is what I built, it worked, and that’s why I chose to leave it just the way it is.</p>
