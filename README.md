# 💻Project in Java

<p>This project was developed in early 2023 and aims to create a friendly and interactive environment between the player and the computer</p>

# 🫵🏽 The choice

<p>The chosen game this time was "Battleship". Is it true that developing this type of game would be easier in another programming language rather than Java? Yes, it is.</p>
<p>But for those who enjoy a challenge, developing this game in Java was a great choice.</p>
<p>A choice that came with many headaches, several months of development, but in the end, what matters is that it worked -- and it was a success.</p>

# 🎮O jogo

<p>The game is 100% developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming. The menus were mostly created through lines of code, with a small part built using features from the compiler used: "Eclipse IDE".</p>

<p>At the time, this was the longest and most difficult project I had ever done.</p>
<p>Connecting multiple menus, files, images, lines of code, and buttons to create a sense of harmony was the main challenge.</p>

<p>For a 16-year-old who had only worked with C++ before, switching to Object-Oriented Programming in Java was no easy task.</p>

<p>I admit, there may be some lines of code that are unnecessary or could be optimized, but at 16, this is what I built, it worked, and that’s why I chose to leave it just the way it is.</p>
